\subsection*{16.1 \& 16.2}
We will look at the government, the third party, in this chapter.
\par
In order for a government to be able to create a functioning economy, 
they need to have a monopoly on violence. Only the government can have an army,
police force, legal system, etc...
\par
Society decides the appropriate level of monopoly power for the government.
\par
The government needs to create an informal defense on how the society operates.
By creating a monopoly on violence, any change in supply and demand are going to 
find their way towards a new equilibrium.
\par
The government's monopoly allows for innovation and development in the economy.
Innovation leads to profit because the government gives you patents.
\par
The government needs to balance its grip on the economy.
The grip can change over time.
