\begin{definition}
    \emph{Price Controls} usually exist because the government objects 
    to what the market is producing as an equilibrium outcome.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    \emph{Price Floors} are the lowest price you are allowed to pay and charge in the market.
\end{definition}
To bind or make a price floor relevant, it must be above the equilibrium price.
A price floor below or equal to equilibrium is non-binding.\\
The impact of a price floor is a surplus of the good. The issue is that the surplus
cannot go anywhere. The supplier makes the government buy the surplus.\\
The consumers are "losers" because they are not able to buy the good at the equilibrium price.\\
The only "winners" are a small portion of the suppliers.\\
Trying to remove the policy will make the winners vocal.
