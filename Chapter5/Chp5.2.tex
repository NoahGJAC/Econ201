\begin{definition}
    \emph{Price Ceiling} is the highest price you are allowed to pay and charge in the market.
\end{definition}
To bind or make a price ceiling relevant, it must be below the equilibrium price.\\
The impact of a price ceiling is that the quantity demanded goes up and the quantity supplied goes down.\\
This creates a shortage of the good.\\
A black market is created because there are consumers willing to pay more than the price ceiling and the price equilibrium.\\
There are a small number of consumers that are "winners" because they are able to buy the good at a lower price.\\
The "losers" are the suppliers because they are not able to sell the good at the equilibrium price.
