\underline{Demand and supply through a new lens}
\par
Demand is a proxy for value. The more you are willing to pay for a good, the more you value it.\\
Supply is a proxy for cost. As long as price covers cost of production, suppliers are willing to produce.\\

The triangle to the left of the equilibrium benefits economic wellbeing. 
It is called total surplus. As a measure of efficiency.
