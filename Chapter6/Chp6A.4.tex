\subsection*{Appendix A.4}
With the indifference curve and budget constraint,
if price of good 1 decreases, the budget constraints to the right.
Knowing the previous and new optimal points, where do the substitution
and income effect come into play? The substitution effect shows that
the quantity of good 1 and good 2 will change on the tangent of the budget constraint.\\
The income effect is the tangent of the old slope onto the new slope of the budget constraint.
