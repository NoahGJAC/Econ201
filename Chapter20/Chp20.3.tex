This section covers Current trade policy.\\
Let's look at a free trade agreement, customs union and common market.\\
A free trade agreement is when two countries agree to trade with each other without any restrictions,
they may freely impose tariffs on other countries as they wish.\\
A customs union is a free trade agreement but the external tariff on other countries is the same.\\
A common market is a customs union but with the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour within the borders/countries.
\par
Trade creation is when a country imports from a more efficient producer because of a trade agreement.\\
Trade diversion is when a country imports from a less efficient producer because of a trade agreement.
