\subsection{}
In imperfect competition, you either have many small firms (monopolistic competition) or few large firms (Oligopoly).
\par
A concentration ratio is the percent of sales go to the top firms. The more sales that are taken from higher firms means it is more monopolistic and less perfectly competitive.
\par
Imperfect competitions have differentiated products (e.g. fast food burgers). The more differentiated the product is the more monopolistic the market.
\par
Imperfect competition has some degree of price-making power. Exerting too much influence leads to your competitors punishing you. Firms compete in ways other than price. They compete through
advertisements, quality and the basis of creating barriers (exclusivity).
