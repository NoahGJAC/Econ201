What if the player's in a game try to collude?\\
In an overt (out in the open) collusion, the government will get involved, because competition is good for the consumer.\\
The alternative is tacit (quiet or implied) collusion.
\par
Collusion works best if there is monitoring and enforcement.
\par
In oligopolies, the firms are making profits, prices are above costs, meaning they would collude to prevent other firms from entering the market.
\par
Barriers can be seen as branding (veblen goods).\\
Advertising is an extension of branding.\\
Advertising is getting a consumer to buy something they would otherwise not buy.\\
This is damaging to the consumer's utility and economic efficiency.\\
Most advertising is deceptive.

Predatory pricing is when a firm threatens to lower prices to drive out competitors.
