\subsection{}
In the long run, firms can change all their inputs.
Capital and labour are not fixed.\\
They change their inputs in relation to marginal production of capital (MPK) and marginal production of labour (MPL).\\
If MPK $>$ MPL, the firm will increase capital and decrease labour until $\frac{MPK}{P_K} = \frac{MPL}{P_L}$.\\
$\frac{MPK}{P_K} = \frac{MPL}{P_L}$ is called technical efficiency.\\
$\frac{MPK}{MPL} = \frac{P_K}{P_L}$ is called the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS).\\
At a given output, minimizing costs maximizes profits.
\par
Long run average cost (LRAC) is connected to the short run average cost (SRAC).\\
Convex hull is the LRAC curve formed from the SRAC curves.\\
Increasing returns to scale (IRS) or economics of scale is when LRAC decreases as output increases (doubling inputs, more than doubles the quantity).\\
Constant returns to scale (CRS) is when LRAC remains constant as output increases (doubling inputs, doubles the quantity).\\
Decreasing returns to scale (DRS) or diseconomies of scale is when LRAC increases as output increases (doubling inputs, less than doubles the quantity).\\
The minimum efficient scale (MES) is the point where CRS begins.\\
Returns to scale come from specialization and division of labour.
