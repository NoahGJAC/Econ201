\begin{definition}
    \emph{Elasticity of Supply} is the measure of how much the quantity supplied changes when the price changes.
\end{definition}
The determinants are shared with Elasticity of Demand.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ceteris Paribus, The more substitutes the product has, the more elastic its demand is.
    \item Ceteris Paribus, the more of your budget this good takes up, the more elastic demand for it is.
    \item Ceteris Paribus, the more time you have to adjust, the more elastic your demand for the product will be.
\end{enumerate}
Consumers and producers can view products differently leading to different elasticities.\\
