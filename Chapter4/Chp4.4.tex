What if the price that's being changed and the quantity of being affected are different products?
\begin{definition}
    \emph{Cross-price elasticity} is the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good divided by the percentage change in price of another good.
\end{definition}
The sign of the cross-price elasticity matters.
\begin{gather}
    \eta<0 \rightarrow \text{Complements}\\
    \eta=0 \rightarrow \text{Unrelated}\\
    \eta>0 \rightarrow \text{Substitutes}
\end{gather}
What if we are talking about income change instead of price change?
\begin{definition}
    \emph{Income elasticity $(\eta^Y)$} is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.
\end{definition}
\begin{equation}
    \eta=\frac{(Q_1-Q_0)}{(Y_1-Y_0)}\cdot\frac{Y_0}{Q_0}
\end{equation}
\begin{gather}
    \eta>0 \rightarrow \text{Normal Good}\\
    \eta=0 \rightarrow \text{Unrelated to Income}\\
    \eta<0 \rightarrow \text{Inferior Good}
\end{gather}
