\subsection{}
Inputs that are outputs from some other firm are called intermediate products.
Should firms always maximize profits?\\
Companies that have a higher calling, still need to maximize profits to stay in business.\\
Profits incentivize firms to achieve goals.\\
Total revenue is the price of the product times the quantity sold.
\begin{equation}
    TR = P \times Q
\end{equation}
The amount that a firm produces is equal to amount of resources that the firm has.\\
\begin{equation}
    Q = f(K,L)
\end{equation}
Land is combined with capital.
\par
We can split the production function into two parts, the short run and the long run.\\
The short run is when at least one factors of production are fixed.
Capital is harder to change than labor.
\begin{equation}
    Q = f(\overline{K}, L)
\end{equation}
\par
The long run is when no factors of production are fixed but technology is. The very long run has no fixed factors of production or technology.
