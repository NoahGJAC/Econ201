\subsection{}
The goal of the firm is to maximize profits.\\
We use the greek letter $\pi$ to represent profit.
\begin{equation}
    \pi = \text{Total Revenue}(TR) - \text{Total Explicit and Implicit Costs}(TC)
\end{equation}
\begin{definition}
    Explicit cost, loosely, is something you can get a receipt for.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    Implicit cost are distinctly economics, you can't get a receipt for it but it is a cost for doing business.\\
    For example, if you own a business, the salary you could have earned from your work is an implicit cost.
\end{definition}
Accounting profits are always greater than economic profits.\\
$\pi_A > \pi$.\\
Opportunity cost is contained within implicit cost.
